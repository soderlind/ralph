Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- The PRD JSON file provided as context (do not assume its path)
- progress.txt

Task:
- Pick ONE small, highest-impact PRD item.
- Implement it with minimal changes.
- Do NOT run shell commands unless explicitly required (assume shell tools may be denied).

Required outputs:
- Update the PRD JSON file to reflect what now passes.
- Append a short note to progress.txt describing what changed.

Integrity rule:
- Only claim commands/checks passed if you actually ran them.

Stop condition:
- If you believe all PRD items are complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
