Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- The PRD JSON file provided as context (do not assume its path)
- progress.txt

BEFORE choosing a feature:
1. **Check current architecture** — Read progress.txt to see what's been built.
2. **Verify high-level sufficiency** — Ask: "Does the current architecture support the next feature?"
   - If YES → implement the feature directly (no refactoring needed)
   - If NO → identify what architectural work is needed first, then add that as the next priority

THEN implement:
1. Find the highest-priority feature/architecture task (YOU decide priority, not necessarily list order).
2. Check that the types check via pnpm typecheck and that the tests pass via pnpm test.
3. Update the PRD JSON file with the work that was done (mark features as complete, adjust priorities).
4. Append your progress to progress.txt.
   - Be clear about what was built and why (for the next person)
   - Call out any architectural decisions
   - Note dependencies for next tasks
5. Make a git commit of that feature/task.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE/TASK.
If, while implementing, you notice the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
